Media Converter GUI

A simple, user-friendly media converter built with Python's tkinter library. This application leverages the power of ffmpeg to convert audio and video files between various formats.

Features
Graphical Interface: Intuitive GUI built with tkinter.
Input & Output Selection: Easily browse for input files and specify output file paths.
Format Options: Choose from a list of common video and audio formats:
Video: mp4, avi, mkv, mov, webm
Audio: mp3, wav, flac, aac, ogg

Automatic Filename Suggestion: Automatically fills the output filename based on the input filename and selected format.
Smart Conversion: If converting an audio file to a video format, a dummy video track with a black background is added to ensure compatibility.
Error Handling: Provides clear error messages if issues arise during file selection or conversion.

Prerequisites
Python 3: Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
tkinter: Typically bundled with Python. If not, install it via your package manager.
ffmpeg: Must be installed and accessible from your system's PATH. Download it from ffmpeg.org.

Installation
Clone the Repository or Download the Script:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/media-converter-gui.git
Or simply download the media_converter.py file to your preferred directory.

Navigate to the Project Directory:
cd media-converter-gui

Verify ffmpeg Installation:
Run the following command in your terminal to ensure ffmpeg is installed:

ffmpeg -version

Usage
Make the Script Executable (Optional):

If you're on a Unix-like system, you can make the script executable:
chmod +x media_converter.py

Run the Application:
You can start the application by running:
./media_converter.py

Or with Python explicitly:
python3 media_converter.py

Using the GUI:
Input File: Click the Browse button next to the "Input File" field to select your media file.
Output Format: Use the dropdown to choose your desired output format.
Output File: Click the Browse button next to the "Output File" field to select where to save the converted file.
Convert: Click the Convert button to start the conversion process. A message will display upon successful conversion, or an error message if the process fails.

How It Works
tkinter GUI: The application creates a simple graphical user interface using Python's tkinter module.
File Browsing: Users can browse for files using the standard file dialog.
ffmpeg Conversion: Based on user input, the script constructs and executes an ffmpeg command:

Standard Conversion: For most conversions, it simply passes the input and output paths to ffmpeg.
Audio-to-Video Conversion: If the input is an audio file and the output format is video, the script adds a dummy video track (a black background) to ensure the output is a valid video file.
Subprocess Handling: The conversion process is handled using Pythonâ€™s subprocess module, capturing both standard output and error messages to inform the user of the process status.

Error Handling
Invalid Input File: Displays an error if the selected input file does not exist.
Missing Output File: Prompts the user to specify an output file if none is provided.
Conversion Errors: Any issues during the conversion process will trigger an error message with details from ffmpeg.
